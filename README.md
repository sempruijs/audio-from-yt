# Audio from youtube

Do you want to scrape audio from a youtube video without shady websites?
This is the place to be.

Make sure you run [nix](https://nixos.org) with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and run the following command:

```shell
nix run github:sempruijs/audio-from-yt
```

This wil run a bash script that will scrape the audio for you.

Under the hood, it uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

enjoy!
